The library consists of one room. At the entrance is a librarian's desk.

There is only one librarian, named <TBD>.

The library contains many interesting texts, but they have been having some
trouble with the computer catalog system and no one can find any of the books.
People attempting to search for the books without consulting the computer
catalog to determine the correct location risk experiencing a SEGFAULT and going
to the health center (across the hall) to recover.

The library contains one microcomputer for the book catalog system and several
more for general use. The computers are all Raquette 2 Microcomputers, the
standard instructional machine of the college.
