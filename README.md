# Computer-Seance
The history of computing is fairly well-preserved in a technical sense.
The internet holds countless software archives, ROM dumps, emulators, scans of documentation, schematics, and more.
However, the layperson will probably never be aware of, much less study these resources.
This is the role of the historian.

What is needed is a way to showcase the way computing once existed.
To convert manuals and specifications into something more tangible.
To give a voice to the computers and software of the past.
A computer s√©ance, if you will.

## Raquette
Raquette is an SDL-based interactive emulator for a 6502 system inspired by a classic computer named after a fruit.
The graphic modes work, and disk support is in progress. Sound output is not supported yet, nor tape data IO.
Once the hardware emulation is more complete I will work on software, including a ROM since all compatible BASIC ROMs are still considered proprietary.
That said, if you have your own backup of a compatible ROM, it will run fine and you will be able to write BASIC programs.
I will also need to write a disk operating system for it in order for that feature to be at all useful.

## Future Ideas
I would like to add emulators for more advanced classic-inspired architectures (mainframe, mini, etc). A navigable RPG-style overworld with visuals of each machine would be nice too. Like a virtual museum.
