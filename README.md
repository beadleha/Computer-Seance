# Computer-Seance
The history of computing is fairly well-preserved in a technical sense.
The internet holds countless software archives, ROM dumps, emulators, scans of documentation, schematics, and more.
However, the layperson will probably never be aware of, much less study these resources.
This is the role of the historian.

What is needed is a way to showcase the way computing once existed.
To convert manuals and specifications into something more tangible.
To give a voice to the computers and software of the past.
A computer s√©ance, if you will.
